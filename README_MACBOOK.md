# 🍎 MacBook Development Environment - Ready!

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Time Travel Hotline project is now fully set up on your MacBook for development and testing.

### What's Working:
- ✅ **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python 3.9.6 environment
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed and compatible
- ✅ **Audio System**: MacBook Pro Microphone & Speakers tested
- ✅ **Application**: Running in text mode (voice mode ready with API keys)
- ✅ **Code Compatibility**: Fixed for Python 3.9 and older Deepgram SDK

### Quick Start Commands:

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Test text mode (no API keys needed)
python hotline_demo_windows.py --text-mode

# 3. Test voice mode (requires API keys in .env)
python hotline_demo_windows.py

# 4. Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### Development Workflow:

1. **Activate Environment**: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. **Make Changes**: Edit code, test features
3. **Test Locally**: Run with `--text-mode` or voice mode
4. **Commit & Push**: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`
5. **Deploy to Pi**: Pull changes on Raspberry Pi

### Next Steps:

1. **Set up API keys** in `.env` file for full voice functionality
2. **Install ffmpeg** for better audio processing (optional)
3. **Start developing** new features!
4. **Test on Raspberry Pi** when ready

### Files Created/Modified:
- `venv/` - Virtual environment
- `.env` - Environment variables (needs your API keys)
- `SETUP_MACBOOK.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `hotline_demo_windows.py` - Updated for compatibility

### Troubleshooting:
- **Audio issues**: Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone
- **API errors**: Verify `.env` file has correct API keys
- **Environment issues**: Delete `venv/` and recreate with `python3 -m venv venv`

**You're all set! 🚀**

The MacBook environment is ready for development. You can now iterate on features locally and deploy to your Raspberry Pi when ready.
